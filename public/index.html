      <p>I grew up as this internet did. Its evolution has basically happened over the course of my lifetime so I am surely interested in where it is going. This was an interesting read because it has funny parallels to parts of my life. I went to school for design so the great debate over designers learning to code or developers learning design is super relevant to me. I did a lot of work with developers at a previous job and there was a lot of breakdown in communication about what something should look like. </p>
      <p>I had the privilege of being a user of the internet since a young age, but did not consciously notice things like the design and structure of websites until my mid-teens when I took an interest in art and design.  I went to design school from 2008-2012, right smack in the middle “the times of the flat”. It makes me laugh a little because I can remember our mockups evolving from drop shadows and bevels to icons and vectors very clearly.</p>
      <p>My current experience of the “the bright future” is platforms like Squarespace which are useful but tend to turn my stomach because they put designers (and developers) in a less desired position. That being said, there is a true mastery and theory behind the displaying of content well and I’m interested to hear more about the tools that Ruluks mentions in the article. I think there are also solutions involving the integration of design and development teams. In my past, when there were issues, the problems could always be solved with more open lines of communication; from detailed mockups/wireframes to clear reasoning about how/why something could/couldn’t be done.  </p>
      <p>I’m very excited to learn these more about development in order to initiate a future of web like this. </p>
